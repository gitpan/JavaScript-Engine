JavaScript::Engine 0.01

This is just a pointer to JE, a pure-Perl ECMAScript
(JavaScript) engine.

"JE" stands for JavaScript::Engine (following the example of PPI). I
put this here on the CPAN so that one might be able to  find JE when
typing "i /javascript/" in the CPAN shell.

The "Makefile.PL" file in this package lists JE as a prerequisite, so
if you try installing this with CPAN.pm, it will install JE for you.
